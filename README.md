# Form-Generator

UCC Societies Form Generator for making EGM/AGM Google Forms

Import script into Google Apps Scripts (GAS) 


GAS hates Google Drive, especially in terms of images. 

You may upload images to the Drive, set permissions to "Anyone can view" and it would still reject it. Hence the creation of this Repo






todo:
- Add section in form where users may input a role with multiple openings
    - this will be a combination of an input box and a dropdown to its left or right with the numbers

- PRSTV system, its a big one

- Slight error when others are using it
      - files aren't generating
- need a good system on finding the right path to folder
- also would be nice to gen a docx with role and shorted link of form
